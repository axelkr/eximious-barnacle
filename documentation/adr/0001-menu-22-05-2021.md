# Menus of top-level views

* Status: accepted

## Context and Problem Statement
A menu at the top enables user to navigate to other parts of the program. However, that menu is not the same for each view.  

## Decision Outcome
Generic menu entries are provided in a module. Every top-level view has one component, named _module name_-menu, which contains the menu for that view.
